## ATutor XML Sitemap Module

This simple module generates a standardized XML sitemap that can be submitted to various search engines to provide more efficient indexing of the content within PUBLIC ATutor courses. 

## HOW To Use
Once installed, open the mods/sitemapxml/sitemap.php file and add the course ids in the $courses_sitemap array

For example:
$courses_sitemap = array(5, 13);  //where 5 and 13 are the ids of public courses to be indexed

The open the sitemap file in a Web browser to see the result. 
http://mysite.com/ATutor/mods/sitemapxml/sitemap.php

If you see a series of XML blocks something like the following, that includes URLs to all the content pages of the courses specified in the $courses_sitemap array, the sitemap URL should be ready to submit to search engines.
